## ü§ñ Model Description

The customer segmentation model classifies customers into distinct groups based on the following features:

| Feature    | Type    | Description                            |
|------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| **CID**       | Integer | Unique identifier for each customer   |
| **Recency**   | Integer | Days since the customer's last purchase |
| **Monetary**  | Float   | Total amount spent by the customer    |
| **Frequency** | Integer | Number of purchases made by the customer |

The model uses these features to segment customers into meaningful groups such as loyal, at-risk, or new customers, helping businesses optimize marketing efforts.
